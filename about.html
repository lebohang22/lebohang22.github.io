            <h4>A good-natured, open-minded problem-solver with a strong sense of self.
                Trustworthiness and integrity form an integral part of who I am. Resilient in every
                aspect, I am no stranger to challenges and I am externally aware. </h4>

                <h4 style="color: coral;">Believes in prudent listening and communication are the key to forming healthy
                    relationships, professionally and otherwise. Very passionate about helping people in
                    any way possible, after all, one kind gesture can change the world, one individual, at
                    a time, thus believing in teamwork.</h4>

                    aspires to bring motivation and hope to herself and everyone. I am a beacon of hope
                    to those in despair that there is indeed a brighter tomorrow, and it starts with the
                    readiness to work hard.</h4>
